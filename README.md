# Non linear models for toxicity prediction

The findings of [Improved QSAR Analysis of the Toxicity of Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:RUGC.0000018657.40304.45) found improvements in predicting aquatic toxicity of carboxylic acids when using a particular set of molecular and topological parameters. The statistical methods employed were linear, and polynomial in nature which relied upon removing predictors. We attempt to establish a stronger predictive relationship using purely nonlinear methods while retaining all predictors.
